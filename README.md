# neuralnet
I read up on the mathematics behind neural nets a few days ago then I decided to try to write one. It's in Rust because Rust is currently the language I'm most familiar with, and I know next to nothing on Data Science before reading, so this is mainly just me experimenting around.
The repo contains a currently-WIP implementation of a neural net using SGD and the sigmoid activation function.
